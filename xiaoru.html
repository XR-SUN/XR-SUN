            Having been learning to code by myself, I recognize the need for a structured learning experience with like-minded peers in a supportive community.
            Coders and Foudners' curriculum focuses on hands-on projects and collaboration, aligns with
            my learning goals.<br>
            I love the sense of community that coders and founders built and I a eager to
            be a part of it!
